EEPROM
Want to last 20 years and each byte can handle 1M writes --> 1 write every 600 seconds

Keys
1 - Back/Cancel
2 - Down
3 - Up
4 - Settings/Modify/Accept


Home
    Setting - Display off

Voltage
    Setting - Multiplier
    Setting - Offset

Soc - measured
    Setting - Resistance mOhm
    Setting - Hysteresis mV

Current
    Setting - capacity per pulse mAs

Soc - counted
    Setting - Soc adjust
    Setting - Soc set from measured
    Setting - Capacity Ah

Percentage

  0% = -0.5 to   0.4999%
  1% =  0.5 to   1.4999%
 50% = 49.5 to  50.4999%
 99% = 98.5 to  99.4999%
100% = 99.5 to 100.4999%

so add 0.5 and take whole part

Charge routine
==============
Suppose target is 50% or 140Ah
Start charge when SoC falls below 50.0%
Start discharge when SoC reaches 51.0%
Start neutral when SoC reaches 50.9%
